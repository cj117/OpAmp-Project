Operational Amplifiers are electronic devices known for their wide range of applications. Some characteristics of this circuit, such as:\newline
    1. High input and low output impedance\newline
    2. High gain values\newline
    3. Different modes of operation\newline
    etc. make them an important part in IC design\newline \newline
    This project aims to create a simple Op-Amp design to be used as a high gain buffer using 180nm CMOS technology.
    AIM-SPICE software will be used to design and simulate this circuit.
